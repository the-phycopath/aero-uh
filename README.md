**#aero-uh**
This is a repo documenting mine (and previous years) designs and documentation of UH's aeronautics team. I started this repo as a productive intro to learning about github repos and dipping my toes into other computer coding projects. Some of these files have not been reviewed and remain in the state they were originally uploaded in, so please keep that in mind.
