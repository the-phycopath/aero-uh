motor mount location (distance from prop clearance vertically and cg front to back)
lock in wood and 3d printed with a singular bolt (locate and affix at the same time with the side plate)
make slot to drop in hex nut instead of trying to integrate (makes it easier to print)
make sure to balance the wood-3d print thickness at the location where the nose cone and wood side plate meet

blend the fuselage into the wings (no right angles on meet)
bottom may be filet(but not plain filet, tapers downward them filets), top could taper to meet more gradually with top of fuselage

tail boom interface for 20 by 20 carbon tube still needs done
all that is not done is axial constraint (literally just put two bolts through the damn thing)
3d print the part ("block with a hole through it")
Tail boom interface with fuselage ("block of material in between two side plates (the block of material will be the 3d printed tail boom interference))
-have the side plate try to follow the back shape of the fuselage (back taper)
-try not to make things too large (except the side plates, they are the big load paths, justifiable to make it bigger into one piece)

ribs (parallel with ground plates means monokote is supported all the way to the back)
the best solution is both par and perp, but for our purpose parallel with ground ribs are best, with one or two ribs going up and down

for back section, carve foam block for shape on the back section

vertical ribbing further forward on the fuselage but any further back will be foam-sideplate-tail boom interface-sideplate-foam

sketch out bays in same sketch as wing sketch

instead of extruding wing sketch, loft and mirror instead
